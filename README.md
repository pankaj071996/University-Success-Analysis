# University Success Analysis - Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes university rankings across different systems to understand the factors influencing university positions and track changes in performance metrics over time. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, trends, and correlations between various ranking criteria and university success.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Exploration and Understanding**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL and Excel to understand dataset patterns, trends, and outliers
- **Data Aggregation and Transformation**: Clean and transform data for analysis and visualization
- **Visualization in Power BI**: Develop interactive dashboards for insights into university rankings, criteria impact, and temporal changes

## Analysis Insights
The analysis reveals that specific ranking criteria, such as research output and academic reputation, significantly influence university positions across different systems, highlighting the need for universities to strategically focus on these areas to improve their global rankings.

7. Criteria weight differences across ranking systems
8. Temporal changes in ranking criteria weights
9. Relationship between university scores and student-staff ratios
10. Female student distribution across universities
11. Global distribution of universities
12. Temporal changes in university rankings
13. Trends in female student percentages over time
14. Evolution of university ranking scores
15. Relationship between ranking scores and student numbers over time

## Key Findings
- Strong positive correlation (0.871) between a country's GDP and number of universities
- Moderate positive correlation (0.672) between country population and university count
- Universities ranked by Times Higher Education World University Rankings have higher international student percentages (avg. 19.97%)
- Arizona State University has the highest student enrollment
- Positive correlation between university ranking scores and improved student-staff ratios
- Universities from countries with strong research output and funding (US, UK) consistently rank higher

## Tools Used
- SQL for data exploration and analysis
- Excel for data transformation and initial visualization
- Power BI for interactive dashboards and visualization
